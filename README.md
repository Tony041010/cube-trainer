# Cube-Trainer
CubeTrainer v0.1 helps new learners in speed-cubing to memorize 7 essential algorithms.
# Background

CFOP is a common method to solve a Rubikâ€™s cube used by top cubers. CFOP stands for the 4 steps to solve a cube - Cross, F2L, OLL, and PLL. Solving a cube under 20 seconds with CFOP requires the person to muscle-memorize 78 algorithms, to recognize patterns speedy, etc, which requires practices and good learning strategies. In this project, we identify 7 essential OLL algorithms and build a learning tool based on them.
# Overview

CubeTrainer v0.1 trains a learner to muscle-memorize the 7 essential OLL algorithms by doing the followings repeatedly:

Selects one algorithm using sorting strategy S,

Shows the selected algorithm to the user, 

Collects the time that the user spends on memorizing the algorithm to update sorting strategy S.

As a result, we observe a decreasing time spent by the user on the OLL step.
